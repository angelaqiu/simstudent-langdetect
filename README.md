langdetecttest contains the language detector that works as intended, but the accuracy for language detection is only around 85% and the library is no longer updated. newlangtestv5 contains the language detector that should be more accurate and the library is still being worked on, but readBuiltIn() doesn't work as it should, and all languages are being considered (which makes accuracy very, very low).
